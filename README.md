Run in terminal sudo sh night_light_fix.sh and reboot. Thanks to MarcusEngine at clearlinux.org for this fix! The faulty sqlite database file seemed to be the issue for setting color profiles and night light on Gnome 47 with Wayland. Removing any corrupt or faulty .db files and setting proper permissions and ownership fixed the issue.
